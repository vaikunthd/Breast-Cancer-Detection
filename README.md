# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Detection

> Empowering early diagnosis through AI and mobile technology

## 📱 Android App + 🧠 Deep Learning

This project combines the power of deep learning with the accessibility of mobile technology to aid in breast cancer detection.

---

### 🔬 What It Does

- Analyzes breast X-ray images
- Classifies tumors as malignant or benign
- Provides quick results through a user-friendly Android app

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Deep Learning Model**
   - Trained on a dataset of breast cancer X-rays
   - Utilizes convolutional neural networks for image classification

2. **Android Application**
   - Allows users to upload X-ray images
   - Sends images to the trained model for analysis
   - Displays results: Malignant or Benign

### 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/vaikunthd/Breast-Cancer-Detection.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Breast-Cancer-Detection

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📱 App Usage

1. Install the APK on your Android device
2. Open the app and grant necessary permissions
3. Upload a breast X-ray image
4. Wait for the analysis result
