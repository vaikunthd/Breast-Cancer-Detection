# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Detection

> Empowering early diagnosis through AI and mobile technology

## 📝 Background

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. This project aims to leverage deep learning and mobile technology to make breast cancer screening more accessible and efficient.

## 📱 Android App + 🧠 Deep Learning

This project combines the power of deep learning with the accessibility of mobile technology to aid in breast cancer detection.

### 🔬 What It Does

- Analyzes breast X-ray images
- Classifies tumors as malignant or benign
- Provides quick results through a user-friendly Android app

### 🧑‍🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Gathered and preprocessed a labeled dataset of breast cancer X-ray images.
   - Applied normalization and augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.

2. **Deep Learning Model**
   - Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
   - Trained and validated the model on the preprocessed dataset.

3. **Android Application Integration**
   - Built an Android app that allows users to upload X-ray images.
   - Integrated the trained model via an API or on-device inference.
   - App displays classification results: Malignant or Benign.

### 📊 Results

- Achieved high classification accuracy on the test dataset (96% accuracy, 96% precision, 99% recall).
- The Android app provides results within seconds, making it suitable for real-time screening.

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Deep Learning Model**
   - Trained on a dataset of breast cancer X-rays
   - Utilizes convolutional neural networks for image classification

2. **Android Application**
   - Allows users to upload X-ray images
   - Sends images to the trained model for analysis
   - Displays results: Malignant or Benign

### 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/vaikunthd/Breast-Cancer-Detection.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Breast-Cancer-Detection

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📱 App Usage

1. Install the APK on your Android device
2. Open the app and grant necessary permissions
3. Upload a breast X-ray image
4. Wait for the analysis result

### ⚠️ Limitations

- The model's performance depends on the quality and diversity of the training data.
- Not intended to replace professional medical diagnosis; results should be reviewed by healthcare professionals.
- App performance may vary across different Android devices.
